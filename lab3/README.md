# Lab 3 â€“ Hybrid Migration Plan

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to understand cloud migration strategies and apply them to an on-premises system.  
The lab demonstrates how to discover and assess an existing system (compnents and dependencies) and how to evaluate different migration paths (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and choose an appropriate strategy  
(Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Repurchase) for each component of an application.  


## Objectives
- Analyze an existing on-premises architecture (web app, database, file storage, networking, email).  
- Propose a hybrid migration plan by combining IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services.  
- Justify decisions for each component based on control, scalability, and modernization.  

## reflexion
I think this lab prepare us to next lessons about discovery and assessment process of cloud
migration.

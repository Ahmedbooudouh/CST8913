 ## 4. Migration Approach

 The most likely migration approach for Ramp is Rebuilding. Ramp created a new OCR tool and automated workflows by using Azure AI services. This approach was chosen because it allowed them to modernize their system, gain scalability, improve accuracy, and reduce manual work instead of just moving old systems into the cloud.

 ## 5. High-Level Schedule 

- Discovery (1 week) – Gather information about current infrastructure, applications, and workflows.

- Assessment (1 week) – Identify pain points, define success criteria (time saved, accuracy, costs).

- Planning & Design (1 week) – Select Azure services and design the migration architecture.

- Implementation (2 weeks) – Build the OCR tool and set up workflow automation with Azure.

- Testing & Training (1 week) – Validate accuracy with real data and train staff.

- Deployment (1 week) – Roll out the solution into production.

- Monitoring & Optimization (ongoing) – Track results, scale as needed, and improve performance.

## 6. Main decision criteria for the chosen Ramp

As a fast-growing and innovative startup, Ramp was an ideal candidate to benefit from cloud advantages such as agility, scalability, and flexibility. I chose this case because I used to run my own business, and I understand how valuable their product is. Automating bills and receipts can truly save companies significant time and money.
